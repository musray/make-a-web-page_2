	  <p>This site is mainly about how to learn web developing from very beginning. I've started to learn web developing on <a href="http://www.udacity.com"><strong>Udacity</strong></a> since May, 5th 2015. This site will also be designed to conform the requirements for final projects for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000"><strong>Introduction to Programming Nanodegree</strong></a>.</p>
	  <p>I'm going to put materials from my lesson's notes, as well as my personal experiences on programming, software tools and maybe some useful information from the world wide web.</p>
	  <p>Let's get started!</p>
