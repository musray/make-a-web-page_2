      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-1">What is web development</h1>
      <p>Web development, is the activities of developing a web site for internet. It covers very broad works such as <span class="em-in-article">front-end</span>, <span class="em-in-article">back-end</span>, <span class="em-in-article">web page design</span> and so forth.</p>
      <p>Web development can range from making the single web page of plain text to the most complex web applications, e-comercial and SNS, etc.</p>
      <p>In many companies, the front-end development is oriented to client side coding and user interface codes. If youâ€™re interested in more details, this <a class="fast-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">wikipedia article</a> could give you a big picture about this topic.</p>

      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-2">How internet works</h1>
      <p><em>"The internet is the network of networks"</em>.</p>
      <p>When a people type a URL in his/her web browser and hit ENTER, the browser, also know as the client, sends a HTTP request to the internet. Then a machine called router, which is connecting to the people's computer, take this request and try to find the best or the most optimal path to the destination where this request is sending to.</p>
      <p>There might be a few of routers this request will hopping through before it will arrived at the SERVER at the other end of the internet. The server, might be a computer running Unix or Linux system, will interpret this request and find the related HTML document to this request. Then the server will sent the documents back to the internet, again, through many routers and get the people's computer and browser. The browser interprets the HTML file and renders it according to the structure and content of the HTML, and its companied CSS rules, to a particular web page.</p>

      <h3>Text Editor</h3>
      <p>At very beginning, the most important thing is typing HTML document in an appropriate text editor.</p>
      <p>Although notepad or MS Word are all text editors, but they are not designed for programming. A good text editor for coding should only saves the file in plain text mode and highly effectively. For my personal experience, <span class="em-in-article">VIM</span> is my choice. I would like to open a new page to talk about <span class="em-in-article">VIM</span> specifically.</p>
      <h3>Browser</h3>
      <p>IE probably is not the best choice. Chrome, Firefox and Safari are the most popular browsers for developing. They are fast, reliable, easy-to-use and extendible. And all of them have developer tool for you to check the HTML and CSS behind the web page you are watching. This function is desired by learning web development.</p>

      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-4">Programmers are lazy</h1>
      <p>It's true, programmers are lazy. Because they don't like any repetition in their work, they always try hard to find some way to avoid the repetition.</p>
      <p>Repetition has some disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waste time</li>
        <li>Introduce errors</li>
        <li>Hard to review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since programmers don't like repetition, how to avoid it?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put the always desired codings inside a piece of source code.</li>
        <li>Name the piece of source code. We call the piece of code a <span class="em-in-article">function</span>, or a <span class="em-in-article">procedure</span>.</li>
        <li>Directly call this function by name other than write all the code time by time whenever it's needed. </li>
      </ul>
